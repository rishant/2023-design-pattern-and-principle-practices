# SOLID

## Single Responsibility: [com.principle.solid.single_responsibility]
	Each class should have only one sole purpose, and not be filled with excessive functionality

## Open Closed: [com.principle.solid.openclosed]
	Classes should be open for extension, closed for modification. 
	In other words, you should not have to rewrite an existing class for implementing new features.

## Liskov Substitution: [com.principle.solid.liskov_substitution]
	This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.

## Interface Segregation: [com.principle.solid.interface_segregation]
	Interfaces should not force classes to implement what they canï¿½t do. 
	Large interfaces should be divided into small ones.

## Dependency Inversion: [com.principle.solid.dependency_inversion]
	Components should depend on abstractions, not on concretion.
